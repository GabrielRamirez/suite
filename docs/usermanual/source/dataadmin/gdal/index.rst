Enabling GDAL image formats support
===================================

.. note:: This document only concerns the extra image formats that can be made available in GeoServer via GDAL. The GDAL binaries, such as :command:`gdalinfo` are installed separately.

Boundless Server comes with support for publishing data from many formats supported by the `Geospatial Data Abstraction Library <http://gdal.org>`_ (GDAL).  These formats include DTED, EHdr, AIG, ENVIHdr, and much more.

.. note:: See the :ref:`install` section for more information on the various ways to install Boundless Server.
