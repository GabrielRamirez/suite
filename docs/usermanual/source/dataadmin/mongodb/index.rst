Working with MongoDB
====================

`MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.org/>`_ is a document-oriented "NoSQL" database.

MongoDB databases can be loaded as stores in GeoServer, and certain configured collections inside those databases can be published as layers.

The MongoDB plugin supports MongoDB 3.0 and newer.
