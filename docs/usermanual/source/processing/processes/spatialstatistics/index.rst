Spatial Statistics Processes
============================

In addition to the regular processes included with WPS, Boundless Server Enterprise includes many additional spatial statistics processes.

Full documentation is available on the Spatial Statistics GitHub project page: `GeoServer WPS Processes Manual <https://github.com/mapplus/spatial_statistics_for_geotools_udig/blob/master/docs/manual/GeoServer_WPS_1.0_User_Manual_en_v.2.latest.pdf>`_.

You can also reference the :ref:`list of spatial statistics processes <processing.proccesses.spatialstatistics.list>` for basic API documentation.
